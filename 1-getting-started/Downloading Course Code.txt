Downloading Course Code
As mentioned in the previous lectures, code attachments are made available via Github.

Unfortunately, downloading specific commits as ZIP files can lead to 404 errors - this seems to be a Github bug.

If you're facing this issue, the easiest workaround is to use the Git CLI (get it here) to then clone the repository and check out the commit manually.

Here's how that works:

1) git clone https://github.com/mschwarzmueller/nextjs-course-code.git (requires Git CLI to be installed!)

2) git branch -a => Lists all available branches => Choose the branch that fits the course section you're currently in

3) git checkout <branch-name> => Check out the branch for the course section you're currently in (example: git checkout origin/10-prj-blog)

4) git log => Lists all commits (code snapshots) for this branch

5) git checkout <commit-id> => Checkout the specific commit

This is less convenient than downloading ZIP files but it is a workaround that should work until Github fixed that issue.

There also is a shortcut to checkout a specific attachment that might be linked to a lecture.

For example, this lecture links to a specific commit: https://www.udemy.com/course/nextjs-react-the-complete-guide/learn/lecture/25146402#overview

This is the Github link the lecture links to: https://github.com/mschwarzmueller/nextjs-course-code/tree/cab609415a42a19a29e702853ffb3ae23b64229e

You can immediately see the commit id in the URL => cab609415a42a19a29e702853ffb3ae23b64229e in this case

So you can get that code snapshot by running:

1) git clone https://github.com/mschwarzmueller/nextjs-course-code.git

2) git checkout cab609415a42a19a29e702853ffb3ae23b64229e
